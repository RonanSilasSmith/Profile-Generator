# Profile Generator

### first, a word
This project tells you to include class scripts in it, and run tests for them, but I never actually found a use for classes by the time I finished the project.
Everything is in tact with the scripts and the tests, but just keep that in mind when viewing my project.
I wouldn't say I forgot, I just wasn't making an active effort to insert class objects.
Either way, the requirements never list that I should use the classes, just have them with tests, so I guess that's a small victory?
